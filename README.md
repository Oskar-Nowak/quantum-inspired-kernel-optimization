# Optimization of Kernel-Based Classification Methods Using Quantum Genetic Algorithm

This engineering thesis project focuses on the application of a **Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA)** for optimizing the hyperparameters of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.  
The main objective is to explore how quantum-inspired evolutionary methods can improve the tuning of kernel parameters, particularly for the **RBF** and **Polynomial** kernels, compared to traditional approaches such as **Grid Search** or **Random Search**.
